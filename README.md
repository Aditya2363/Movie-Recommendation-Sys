This repository showcases a robust Movie Recommender System, entirely developed in Python utilizing core Machine Learning principles. The project's goal is to provide highly personalized movie suggestions, significantly enhancing the user's film discovery experience. It delves into various recommendation strategies, including collaborative filtering (e.g., matrix factorization, K-Nearest Neighbors) and content-based filtering. The pipeline involves comprehensive data preprocessing of movie metadata and user interaction data, feature engineering, model training, and rigorous evaluation using relevant metrics like RMSE and precision@k. This system demonstrates practical applications of ML for real-world recommendation challenges, from data ingestion to delivering tailored entertainment choices.
